/* This project was designed to play a part as interop manager between the hack and Terraria.
 * 
 * Interop consists of such things:
 *   1. Signals passing, through which the hack can ask the patch to do things.
 *   2. Block of memory that contains information, e.g. tiles.
 *   
 * Stuff like synchronization should be done through the signals.
 * 
 * So, the first thing we do is define the basic communication codes.
